# CodeForces-Ladders
**Latest ladders for CodeForces Practice**


The main reason I created this, is because the a2oj ladders are pretty outdated (all from 4-5 year old contests). 
Also, the difficulty level of questions in contests has also increased.

I've included a `Solved` column, to easily keep track for those who want to practice all the questions. 
Also, I just added a `Comments` column in the topic-wise ladders, to mark important questions or add notes for later reading. 
Just star the repo and then fork it, and then you can personally update `Solved` column on your own local fork. 

Also, **Follow** me on Github to receive updates about upcoming CF related tools.
